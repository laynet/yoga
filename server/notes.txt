**MIDDLEWARE**
anything you can do with a routehandler you can do with a middleware
gotta use next in arg/param and then use next function in function to pass off to next middleware or routehandler
3rd party middleware (i.e. morgan) doesn't need next called, already configured

MORGAN - app.use(morgan("tiny" || "dev"))

NEVER USE STRING INTERPOLATION - will make you vulnerable to sql injection attacks
const results = await db.query("SELECT * FROM asanas WHERE ID=$1", [req.params.id])
$# is a place holder, so $2 , you would pass in a second parameter like [req.params.id], [second parameter to match $2]
